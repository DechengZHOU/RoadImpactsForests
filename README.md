# RoadImpactsForests
This repository contains Python code and example data to reproduce the key analyses in "Global Impacts of Transportation Infrastructure on Forest Degradation and Loss"—a manuscript submitted to Nature Communications for consideration—including:
1.	CalculatingCEI.py: Computes the Comprehensive Environmental Index (CEI) by integrating 13 environmental variables via principal component analysis (PCA).
2.	CalculatingRoadimpact.py: Quantifies road impacts in road/road-reference interface (RRI) zones using the Grid-wise Environmental Matching for Background Reference (GEM-BR) method.

Core Functionality
1. CEI Calculation (CalculatingCEI.py)
This script processes 13 environmental variables spanning climate, soil, and topography:
(1)	Climate: Precipitation (PRE), near-surface air temperature (TAS), incoming shortwave radiation (RSDS), vapor pressure deficit (VPD)
(2)	Soil: Soil depth (DEPTH), sand content (SAND), clay content (CLAY), soil organic carbon (SOC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH value (PH)
(3)	Topography: Elevation (DEM), aspect (Aspect), slope (Slope)
PCA is applied to these variables, retaining components with cumulative variance ≥85% to derive objective weights for CEI computation, ensuring the index reflects multi-dimensional environmental conditions.

2. Road Impact Quantification (CalculatingRoadimpact.py)
This script implements the GEM-BR method to estimate road impacts (δI) by:
(1)	Screening reference forest cells using six constraints: spatial proximity to road/RRI zones, CEI similarity (minimizing environmental differences), forest cover change <10% (stable forests), plantation fraction <10% (predominantly natural forests), no nighttime lights (low human disturbance), and ≥3 qualified pixels (statistical robustness).
(2)	Computing reference values (Iref) via inverse distance weighting of qualified reference cells.
(3)	Estimating road impacts:
1)	Absolute impact: δI = Iroad – Iref
2)	Normalized relative impact: δIᵣₑₗ = (Iroad − Iref) / (|Iroad| + |Iref|)

Example Data
A 100 km×100 km test window from South America is provided to validate CEI and δI calculations without full global datasets. All data are formatted as point data (1 km spatial resolution) with a unique pointID for each pixel, enabling conversion back to raster using coordinates (X, Y) in the World Sinusoidal projection (CRS: PROJCS["World_Sinusoidal",GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Sinusoidal"],PARAMETER["False_Easting",0.0],PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",0.0],UNIT["Meter",1.0],AUTHORITY["ESRI",54008]]).
